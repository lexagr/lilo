Printing the documentation
==========================

You need the following programs to generate a printable file from the
LaTeX and FIG sources:

  - LaTeX
  - fig2dev from the transfig package (optional)

The LaTeX translations of the FIG files are already included in the
distribution, so you can print the documentation without fig2dev.
WARNING: 'make distclean'  removes those pre-built LaTeX files.

You can also omit all drawings by typing  make dummies . The drawings
are only necessary when processing the technical overview document.

To run LaTeX just type

  make -f Makefile.old

LaTeX issues many "Overfull \hbox" warnings. They can be safely ignored.
LaTeX will be run repeatedly until it stops issuing the message
LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references 
right.

At the end you should get the very old documentation in user.pdf and 
tech.pdf.

Generating user.README
======================

Use the simple tool t2a.pl for converting to ASCII formatted (old) user
documentation:

  perl t2a.pl  <user.tex  >user.README

Online documentation
====================

The (old) documentation can also be found in the web:
